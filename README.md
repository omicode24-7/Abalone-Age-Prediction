# Abalone-Age-Prediction
This project aims to predict the age of the abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it and counting the number of rings through a microscope a boring and time consuming task, to avoid this long process we have used machine learning algorithms to predict the age of an Abalone.
